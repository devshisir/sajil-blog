                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Understand your score</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Once you have decided to pursue a higher credit score, the first step is understanding why your score is not as high as you would 
                     like it to be.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">There are many resources from reputable companies that will offer comprehensive credit checks for free.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Banks, utility companies, property managers, and other lenders who require credit checks submit data to all of their customers  and tenants' credit bureaus.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">IThis data is compiled and given to you when you file a free credit report.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Credit reports usually have a breakdown of your credit score's various components whether you use VantageScore, FICO, or  another type of credit score. </p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Your credit report will help you gauge where you need the most help.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Delinquencies, high balances, and an abundance of hard credit inquiries can all drag your credit score down, but if you don't  know where to start, you'll be aiming at a moving target.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Thankfully, free credit reports are widely available and help you identify your weak spots before taking any further action.</p>
               </div>
               


               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Dispute any inaccuracies on the report</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">If you see accounts that you don't own or delinquencies that are not true on your credit report, file a complaint at once and report  them to the credit bureau. </p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">The big three credit bureaus, Experian, Equifax, and Transunion, Should all have the same data. If there are any erroneous accounts or inaccuracies on your report, they can drag your credit score down.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Resolving these inaccuracies would likely result in a quick boost to your score.</p>
               </div>




               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Pay Your Bills</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Paying your bills on time, and prioritizing your payments is a great way to raise your score.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Service and utility providers report delinquencies directly to the credit bureaus, and if you have missed payments are some of  your bills, reach out to your service provider and see if they would be willing to work with you to help you get caught up and stop 
                  reporting delinquencies to the credit bureaus.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Suppose you can catch up on your bills quickly. In that case, it will have a compound impact on your credit score because an 
                  abundance of positive activity on delinquent accounts will accelerate your score's recovery.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Avoid too many hard inquiries</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">When you apply for a new loan, the lender makes a hard check on your credit history.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Hard checks always drop your score a few points, but it will usually bounce right back after a month or two.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">However, suppose you are in the habit of applying for new credit cards and Loans often. In that case, this will show on your credit report as a negative impact because you may be a riskier borrower if you frequently need access to new lines of credit.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Before applying for new credit, ask yourself if you really need it. Chances are there are other Solutions or offers that don't require a hard credit inquiry.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">If you can stop applying for new credit for a few months, you should rapidly see an increase in your credit score, And hard inquiries  will disappear entirely after two years.</p>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Make Credit Utilization Your Friend</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Credit utilization is a huge component of your credit score. Your credit utilization is the ratio of how much credit you are utilizing  versus how much you have available.</p>
                  <p class="bg_text bg_purple mb_12">For example, if you have a credit card with a limit of $10,000 and your balance is $5,000, your credit ratio would be 50%.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">The optimal credit utilization ratio is 30% or less, but thankfully there are a couple of solutions to negate the impact of a high credit  utilization ratio.</p>
               </div>




               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Ask for higher limits</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">If you are relatively stable and your personal finances, but you keep running into the issue of a high credit utilization ratio, you should  be able to ask your bank or lending company or higher limits on your lines of credit.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">The goal is not to use the higher limit; instead, it will lower your utilization ratio.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">If we refer to our example above, raising your limit from $10,000 to $20,000 will drop your utilization ratio from 50% to 25%, which is in line with an average utilization ratio. </p>
               </div>


               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Keep Your Cards Open</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Another way to boost your score is by keeping old credit cards open instead of closing them when you stop using them.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">As long as there are no annual fees or interest payments, these old credit cards factor into your overall available credit.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">If you close the accounts, your credit utilization ratio will jump because you removed thousands of dollars of available credit from  your accounts. </p>
               </div>



               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Track Your Progress</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">It's been said, <span class="bold text-purple">"you can't manage what you can't measure"</span> and this especially applies to your credit score.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Once you start taking steps to improve your overall credit score, get in the habit of regular credit check-ups for your accounts.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">It wouldn't make sense to do all the hard work to improve your credit score, only to let your efforts slip away.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Many companies, apps, and services are freely available to help you monitor your credit score and offer tools to optimize your finances. </p>
