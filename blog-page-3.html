               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">You may have heard how many Americans do not have enough money in their savings to cover emergencies.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">What you may not know is how pervasive this lack of savings is across-the-board.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Approximately 25% of Americans Have no money saved in any savings account. Only 23% have enough held in their emergency accounts to cover six months of expenses. The rest are somewhere in the middle with some savings, but not enough to cover 
                  significant emergencies.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">To put it in perspective, most Americans could not cover a surprise $1,000 expense without relying on debt or credit cards.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Thankfully, there is a silver lining here for American savings accounts.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Younger people ages 18-30 are serious about taking control of their financial health, and older people are becoming more  financially savvy.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Today we will discuss why emergency savings are so significant, how to open an emergency savings account, and a few pointers to get you on the track to financial health.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Savings vs. Emergency Savings</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">If you have a savings account, it may be because you opened it along with your checking account and use it as a place to keep  money before you move it to your checking account to pay bills.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">You may use your savings account as a rainy day fund or a place to earmark cash for larger purposes.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">An emergency savings account is in addition to your other savings accounts. Its sole purpose is to cover unexpected emergencies such as car repairs, hospital bills, home disasters, etc.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">How much should you save?</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">When people start building an emergency savings account, they often ask how much they should aim to have in the account.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">The pervasive wisdom among financial experts is that emergency savings accounts should have enough cash to cover six months of your expenses.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">In the beginning, this may sound like a tall order since six months of rent, food, and car payments seems like a lot, especially for someone without much already saved.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">However, by making small tweaks to your budget, like utilizing <span class="bold text-purple">automatic transfers</span> to save your paychecks for you, you will see a snowball effect as your savings grow.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Another great trick for saving extra money is taking a deep-dive in your bank and credit card statements to identify where a majority of your money goes. </p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">If you spend most of it on food and going out, maybe reevaluate how much you are spending on those categories.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Or, if you can’t live without certain items, many fantastic budgeting apps can save you thousands of dollars on online and in-person purchases that can help turbocharge your finances without sacrificing your lifestyle.  </p>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Finding the right bank accounts</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Once you begin saving for your emergency account, you may wonder where you should keep the money.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">By and large, the best place to keep emergency savings is somewhere that will generate interest income on the cash, but also somewhere that makes it easy to access your money when you need it.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Although <span class="bold text-purple">investment accounts and Certificates of deposits (CDs)</span> may offer a higher potential return, it may be tricky to get your money out in an emergency.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">On the other hand, traditional savings accounts have such low-interest rates that it may not seem worth it to park your cash there.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Fortunately, you can get the best of both worlds with a high-yield savings account.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">High-yield</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">High-Yield savings accounts are provided by online banks and provide exponentially higher interest rates than brick and mortar banks can offer.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">These banks offer interest rates that track the open market’s interest rates and give their account holders a significantly higher return on their savings.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Rates are low across the board right now, so you may find banks offering <span class="bold text-purple">rates ranging from 0.4%-0.6% APY,</span> which is substantially more than the 0.0025% offered by most big banks.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">The good news is that as interest rates rise, so will the rates for your emergency savings.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Not only will your interest rates rise, but your funds are also insured by the FDIC up to $250,000. </p>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Mixing Money</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">DO NOT mix your emergency savings with your regular savings and checking.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Try to open your high-yield savings account with a different financial institution than the one you use for your daily finances.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">This will help keep your finances organized and keep you from worrying about how much is in your account.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Ignoring It</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Once you start saving, keep your foot on the gas and continue to structure your finances to optimize your savings.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">TIf you adopt a <span class="bold text-purple">“set it and forget it”</span> attitude, it will take much more time to accomplish your savings goal.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Stay proactive and take advantage of direct deposit and automatic transfers to accelerate your savings goals.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Spending it</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">This is the absolute biggest enemy to your emergency savings. </p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Your emergency savings is designed to protect you in case of dire circumstances, so do not dip into it when you want to finance a discretionary purchase or feel like taking some extra cash.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Leaving it alone may seem challenging at first, but as you watch your balance (and financial security) grow, it will become much easier to avoid spending it.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-purple">Trying it together</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Now it’s time to make saving a cool and enjoyable habit.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Creating a successful emergency savings account relies on good behavior and self-discipline.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Once you begin building a healthy savings habit and shaping your budget around positive financial decisions, you will feel more confident in your personal finances, and you will be prepared to make wise money </p>
