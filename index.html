                  <p class="blogDesc">Saving money and investing for retirement is a crucial component of personal
                     finance. Understanding how retirement
                     accounts fit into your plan can alleviate a substantial amount of worry on your journey to and
                     throughout your golden years. When it comes to IRAs, there can be some confusion between
                     Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs, the two most common. The primary difference focuses on when the
                     money in the accounts is taxed, but there are other nuances. Once you understand how the two types
                     of IRAs operate, you should integrate them into your retirement saving strategy.</p>

                  <h3 class="heading_md text-success">When Should You Start Saving for Retirement?</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">There is some debate around retirement planning, but there is unanimous
                     agreement that you should start investing and saving
                     for retirement as soon as you can. <br> Compound interest is the silver bullet that helps wealth
                     accumulate over time. </p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">When you start investing, the returns you generate will be added to your
                     account balance, and future returns will cause that
                     number to grow. </p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">In the graph below, we look at the hypothetical growth of a $10,000
                     investment growing at 10% over 30 years with a $1,000
                     monthly contribution resulting in $2,148,422.29 in savings at the end. </p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">If the interest rate were 1% in a bank account, this same investment would
                     be worth <span class="bold text-success">$430,897.19</span></p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Compound interest is a powerful tool.</p>

                  <h3 class="heading_md text-success">Individual Retirement Accounts</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Since saving for retirement is so important, where should you start?</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">There are many options on the market, but the two most common choices are
                     employer-sponsored accounts like 401ks and
                     <span class="bold text-success">Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).</span></p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">The most significant difference between 401ks and IRAs is that your employer
                     provides the 401k in their benefits package and
                     may offer to match a portion of your contributions. If you leave the company, you can roll the
                     balance into your personal IRA
                     since that is not attached to any outside entity.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">This brings us to an important distinction between traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.
                  </p>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-success">Pre vs. Post Tax</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">IRAs are subject to taxes like other investment products, but there is a
                     crucial difference between when the taxes are paid.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12"><span class="bold text-success">Traditional IRAs</span> are considered
                     pre-tax vehicles, which means your contributions and capital gains are not taxed until you begin
                     withdrawing money from your account during retirement.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">The advantage of deferring taxes until later is that you can contribute a
                     more considerable amount of pre-tax dollars initially,
                     which can lead to higher compounding.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Post-tax contributions fund <span class="bold text-success">Roth
                        IRAs.</span> The money invested through a Roth account is already taxed, so all gains and
                     withdrawals
                     during retirement are tax-free.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">The motivation for this after-tax account stems from the assumption that you
                     will likely retire in a higher tax bracket than you
                     currently are in. </p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">This is a significant tax advantage because by essentially prepaying the taxes at
                     a lower rate, you can potentially save thousands
                     of dollars over the long run.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-success">Contribution Limits</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Since both IRA structures offer powerful incentives to investors, they each have
                     annual contribution limits and income caps to enjoy full benefits.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-success">Traditional</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Traditional IRAs have an annual contribution limit of $6,000 if you are
                     under 50 years old and $7,000 if you are 50 or older to help you "catch up."</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">While there is no income limit for contributing to a Traditional IRA, your
                     contributions may not be tax-deductible if your income is too high.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-success">Roth</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Roth IRAs have the same contribution limits as the Traditional IRA of $6,000
                     if you are under 50 years old and $7,000 if you are 50 or older.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">However, there is an income limit for contributions of $140,000 for individuals
                     and $208,000 for married couples.</p>

                  <h3 class="heading_md text-success">Withdrawal Rules</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc">Whether you invest in a Traditional or a Roth IRA, you are eligible to withdraw
                     funds at the age of 59½.</p>

               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-success">Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">Under the rules for a Traditional IRA, you must begin taking distributions
                     from your account when you reach age 72. The amount of the distribution is determined by your
                     income and tax rate during retirement.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">There are no RMDs for Roth accounts because the taxes were paid at the time you
                     contributed to the account.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="blog_content_item">
                  <h3 class="heading_md text-success">Early Withdrawal Penalties</h3>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">What if you want to withdraw money from an IRA before you turn 59½?</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">If you take an early withdrawal from a <span
                        class="bold text-success">Traditional IRA,</span> you will immediately pay a 10% penalty, along
                     with taxes at your current rate.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">There are certain exceptions where the penalty can be waived, such as
                     becoming disabled, if a spouse receives your account in the event of your death, or cove qualifying
                     expenses such as education or adoption expenses.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">You can withdraw any contributions you made to a <span
                        class="bold text-success">Roth IRA</span> without paying taxes or penalties, which is called a
                     qualified distribution. However, starting any earnings generated by the account have different
                     rules which can impact your ability to
                     take the money out.</p>

                     depending on your current situation.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc mb_12">If you are earlier in your career, a Roth account's after-tax advantages can
                     help you secure serious tax savings over your investment's growth.</p>
                  <p class="blogDesc">As you progress in your career, the pre-tax benefits of a Traditional IRA can
